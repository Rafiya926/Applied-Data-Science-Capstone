Q2. Which of the following queries display the minimum payload mass? 

Data Science Tutorials For Beginners – Part 1 (Introduction) | Tech Tian 
select payload_mass__kg_ from SPACEXTBL 
order by payload_mass__kg_ group by booster_version 
LIMIT 1 
select payload_mass__kg_ from SPACEXTBL 
order by payload_mass__kg_ desc 
LIMIT 1 select min(payload_mass__kg_) from SPACEXTBL 
select payload_mass__kg_ from SPACEXTBL where payload_mass__kg_=(select max(payload_mass__kg_) from SPACEXTBL)

and y to Launch Site and hue to ‘Class’ is sns.catplot(y=”LaunchSite”,x=”FlightNumber”,hue=”Class”, data=df, 
aspect = 1,kind=’cat’) plt.ylabel(“Launch Site”,fontsize=15) plt.xlabel(“Flight Number”,fontsize=15) 
plt.show() sns.catplot(y=”LaunchSite”,x=”FlightNumber”,hue=”Class”, data=df, aspect = 1) 
plt.ylabel(“Launch Site”,fontsize=15) plt.xlabel(“Flight Number”,fontsize=15) 
plt.show() sns.catplot(y=”LaunchSite”,x=”FlightNumber”,hue=”Class”, data=df, aspect = 1,kind=’scatter’)
plt.ylabel(“Launch Site”,fontsize=15)plt.xlabel(“Flight Number”,fontsize=15)
plt.show() sns.catplot(y=”LaunchSite”,x=”FlightNumber”,hue=”Class”, col=”Class”, data=df, aspect = 1)
